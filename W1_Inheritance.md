# Types of inheritance of rares diseases

### Autosomical dominant inheritance
### Autosomical recesive inheritance
### X-linked inheritance
### Mithocondrial inheritance
#### - **Heteroplasmy**: Presence of different Mithocondrial DNA in an individual. Humans contains multiple copies of mithocondrial DNA and it's common that
       mutations affect only some mithocondria. Therefore the individual can have differente levels of **heteroplasmy** and for this reason have different
       degrees of the disease.
### Polygenic inheritance
#### - Polygenic inheritance: Multiple genes cause the disease
#### - Multifactorial disorders: Multiple genes are affected by diverse enviromental factors. This can generate diaseases without inheritance.

### Chromosomal inheritance (Like Down Syndrome)
